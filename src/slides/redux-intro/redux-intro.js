  `Front-end apps are expected to handle more state than ever before`,
  `At some point, you no longer understand what happens in your app as you have lost control over the when, why, and how of its state`,
  `Mixing mutation and asynchronicity is difficult to reason about. Redux tries to make state mutations predtictable`

const Slide4 = BasicSlideMaker(
  `App State`,
  `Your application state is a like a model except there are no setters. This is so that different parts of the code cant randomly change the application state.`,
  `In order to update the state we'll need to dispatch an action`,
  `An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened to make the state change`,
  `If something changed, we know why it changed. Actions are like breadcrumbs of what has happened.`

const Slide5 = BasicSlideMaker(
  `Why use Redux when React already does state management?`,
  `Redux helps to store your entire state in one place.`,
  `You don't have to keep passing props from the Container components to it's children.`,

  `Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers`
